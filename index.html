				<p>This visualization gives a short overview of the various Pokemon types. I use a martini glass structure to guide the user through the visualization. For the stem, I give a brief description of Pokemon types, such as the differences between them and what combat stats are important, that will hopefully give the user enough information to navigate through what I have presented. </p>
				<p>Since my site is static, I decided to make it easier on myself and decide to give each scene the same static, white and black background. This at least won't disorient the viewer and will give a constant visual when navigating the site. When the data starts to appear, I decide to have the chart on the left side and a corresponding information text box on the right side. </p>
				<p>As for my annotations, for the main pie chart I make sure to have a label for the type and count for that slice, in order to make that slice of the chart clear. For the sub-pie charts, </p>
				<p>As for my parameters, the main ones are the different Pokemon types available to view. </p>
				<p>As for my triggers, the 'next' and 'back' buttons are at the bottom of the screen when the action is available. While in the stem portion users can press the 'next' button to further progress, and the 'back' button while in the glass portion to go back to the original pie chart showing all of the types. While on the main pie chart, another trigger is that users can click on any of the slices to view information on that specific type.</p>
