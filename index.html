				<p>This visualization gives a short overview of the various Pokemon types. I use a martini glass structure to guide the user through the visualization. For the stem I show my home page which has the 'About the Visualization' button, and when they click next they get shown a pie chart with an overview of all 18 Pokemon types. For the glass portion, the user can use that same pie chart and click on any one the types and view the average combat stats in a bar chart format. I then allow the user to return to the main pie chart and repeat the process via the 'back' button. They can decide for themselves which Pokemon is the strongest.</p>
				<p>Since my site is static, I decided to make it easier on myself and gave each scene the same static, white and black background. This at least won't disorient the viewer and will give a constant visual when navigating the site. When the data starts to appear, I decide to have the chart on the left side and a corresponding information text box on the right side. The only thing that changes while moving from one chart to another is the actual chart itself and the text inside the textbox. I was very focused on making the coloring in this project work, since the colors of the different types are very distinct. I made sure that each slice had its own distinctive color, and when you click on a slice the bars in the bar chart also match its respective color. Each bar chart's vertical axes is uniform, and the user and still clearly see which stat is larger than another in the visual. </p>
				<p>As for my annotations, for the main pie chart I make sure to have a label for the Pokemon type and count for that slice, in order to make that slice of the chart clear. The text box on the right gives the user a brief overview of the types and a short description for some of them. It encourages users to click on the pie chart for more information on the other types. For the sub-pie charts, the text box on the right displays the absolute value of the different stats and gives a brief description of each one to make it clear for the viewer. I make sure to clear the numerical annotations for each scene, but the textual descriptions stay the same, as it would be exhausting to create a tailored description for each different type.</p>
				<p>As for my parameters, the main ones are the different Pokemon types available to view. In the first chart, the 18 different types are sliced up to show an overview of the type representation in the Pokemon series. Each type has their own different average combat stats, which I show when you click on a slice in the pie chart. The type acts as the main parameter for exploration inside the glass portion of the structure, controlling what data gets pulled from the data files. </p>
				<p>As for my triggers, the 'next' and 'back' buttons are at the bottom of the screen when the action is available. While in the stem portion users can press the 'next' button to further progress down the stem, and the 'back' button while in the glass portion to go back to the original pie chart showing all of the types. The 'next' button is disabled while in the glass. While on the main pie chart, another trigger is that users can click on any of the slices to view combat information on that specific type. When the Pokemon type changes, the average combat stats for that Pokemon will also change in the corresponding bar chart.</p>
				<p>As for sources, I made liberal use of bl.ocks.org to help create the charts, and also various stackoverflow.com articles. The dataset I used and modified was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon</p>
